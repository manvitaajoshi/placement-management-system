# Placement Management System
A portal designed to help students get a job in the company of their interest. The company will hire students accordingly if they fulfil the eligibility criteria.
The database stores information about the students (personal and academic information) and the company along with the jobs it provides. The student can view the details of the company and the prerequisites for the job. After the student applies for a specific role in a company, the company will hire that student if she/he is the right fit for that position.
